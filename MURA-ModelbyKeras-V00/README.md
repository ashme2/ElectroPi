# MURA-ModelbyKeras-V00

MURA Model by Keras is a DL Model which design by Keras API. I wrote this code during my course at Electro Pi (2018), but it's not finished yet. I'll work on completing it very soon.

## MURA: Bone X-Ray Deep Learning Competition
### By Stanford Machine Learning Group

MURA (musculoskeletal radiographs) is a large dataset of bone X-rays. Algorithms are tasked with determining whether an X-ray study is normal or abnormal. MURA is one of the largest public radiographic image datasets. They're making this dataset available to the community and hosting a competition to see if your models can perform as well as radiologists on the task.
